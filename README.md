## JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## Vue.js
Research Conducted By: Brendon Hampton, Chris Bortel, Davee Sok, Joe Pennock

Overall Score and Comments

## Score (Out of 10): 7 or 8

### Front-end stack. General usability and learnability
- The Vue stack is front end. You can write directly into the html 
- Does not need a server. React is like writing backend 
- Tutorial video was super helpful and approachable and increased usability
- CDN, CLI, or NPM options were very nice

### Pros
- Good structure: Template(jsx), Data(state), Methods(redux actions), compute(computes a value of multiple states)
- Uses a CDN: It is integrated and super easy to learn
- Reads and writes like ejs
- Light weight. React app is huge and therefore is faster than react and angular
- 201 or 301 student could figure this out
- Event listener was directly connected to the html which was cool. We listen to the emitted event which triggered action in the parent element
- Wiring in easier
- Good structure
- Faster to start a project
- **Highlight:** Uses a virtual dom and then once everything is evaluated, then the actual dom is updated


### Cons
- Errors are difficult to read and does not show what line of code it is happening on. 
  - Difficult to know what the error is actually about
- React has a whole bunch of resources, Vue is lacking in this area. Docs are not beginner friendly. 
- Not as vetted, big companies do not use it because there is no big backing

## Ratings and Reviews

### [Documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#vercel)
- Not as good as React, but compared to other documentation, they are pretty readable
- We were able to start coding out a project in a few hours
- Does not give as much detail as desired

### Systems Requirements
<!-- Above and beyond ‘node’ and ‘linux’, what dependencies or core requirements exist for this framework? Can it play at AWS/Heroku? Does it require a certain database? -->
- Can be used with a CDN, just a text editor required
- Can be used with Git Hub Pages, Amazon s5, Heroku, Netlify, etc.

### Ramp-Up Projections
<!-- How long would/should it take a team of mid-junior developers to become productive? -->
- To be productive, it will probably take a team of mid-junior developers a week

### Community Support and Adoption levels
<!-- How popular is this framework? What big companies are running on it? How is it “seen” in the general JS community? Is there an active community of developers supporting and growing it? -->
- Second most popular framework
- Big companies are not using it for big stuff
  - FaceBook, Adobe, AliBaba, Git Lab, Nintendo, Buzz Feed
- The JS community likes it
